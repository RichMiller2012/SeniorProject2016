I then spend time teaching the child how to do the job properly and have then stay in that area until the job is mastered. Then the children rotate jobs. \r\n\r\nMy work areas are: \r\n\r\nThe Floors and Table â€“ we have lots of traffic so the floors are a big job. They need to be swept, vacuumed, and mopped several times a day. The table needs to be cleared and washed after meals\r\n\r\nThe Kitchen â€“ clean up after meals, loading and unloading the dishwasher which we run 3 to 4 times a day, cleaning the sink and counters and keeping a tidy and neat appearance. This is a huge job in my house so there are 2 children usually assigned to this. \r\n\r\nClutter Control â€“ There seems to be two or three areas that tend to collect clutter constantly. If it is not managed the clutter is just moved from one of those spots to the next to the next. So someone is responsible to deal PROPERLY with the clutter. \r\n\r\nThe Living Room â€“ keep it vacuumed and neat looking. My living room is not a play area. I have a sunroom off the dining room where I use to keep the toys for my kids. Now my children are older and toys are not much of as much of an issue. They need to respect the living room and keep in orderly.  It is nice to have one area of the home that is orderly on a regular basis.  \r\n\r\nBasement â€“ We have a family room/music room in our basement where the children spend a good deal of time so that needs to be cleaned up and cared for. Our wood furnace is in the basement and there is always a mess from wood being brought in and ash from the furnace. The barn boots, chore coats and overalls for the animal chores are in the basement as well. So the mud and dirt that is tracked in and around the basement needs to be vacuumed and cleaned up regularly. \r\n\r\nBathroom- We have one bathroom, yes just one! Somehow we have managed just fine with one bathroom, but it gets a lot of use each day and needs a thorough cleaning each day.\r\n\r\nDining Room and Sun Room- sweep, vacuum and wash floors, help the younger children keep their toys in order, if necessary.\r\n\r\nBedrooms- my 5 children now at home are divided into 4 bedrooms. The children are responsible for their own rooms. Either my hubby or I regularly make bedroom inspections to make sure they are keeping their rooms clean and in order. \r\n\r\nMany of these jobs overlap, such as clutter control and dining room (this is one area that has a major clutter spot). Each child is also still responsible for their own messes, I donâ€™t allow them to expect that the person in charge of an area will clean up after them. \r\n\r\n', 52, '07 May, 2017', '2017-05-07', '10:26:34'),
(35, 'Clutter Control Tips', 'Good ways to manage the annoying clutter that always manages to make life difficult', NULL, 'Spring is just around the corner and so is spring cleaning!! One of the very first steps in giving your home a good thorough spring cleaning is getting a handle on the clutter!\r\n\r\nFirst you need to do a major de-cluttering of your home if you have not done this recently. Begin this task room by room, or spot by spot; the junk drawer first, the overloaded end table, your desk, etc. Then move through that room until it is done. Make sure you have boxes for things to give away, garbage bags for things to throw away, and a box or container for items that you want to keep but need to find there way to a new home.\r\n\r\nBe ruthless!! Donâ€™t keep anything you really donâ€™t need or that does not have extreme sentimental value to you. The weight of carrying around such items is depressing and can prevent you from moving forward in life. â€œStuffâ€ is not worth the toll it can take on you.\r\n\r\nAfter the spring de-cluttering is done, you will need to develop clutter-free habits. If you build these habits into your life you can break the cycle that allows things to get built up to where they are overwhelming for you.\r\n\r\nKeep the following tips in mind when making new daily habits. If you keep and homemaking journal then write these tips down and read them daily until this is a way of life for you.\r\n\r\n1.Donâ€™t let piles build up. Put things away when finished with them.\r\n\r\n2.Deal with things as they come into the house. Toss the junk mail, file the bills, set the personal mail on your desk and read and respond as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n3.Set times each day to walk around the house and put things into their correct place. My father use to always say, â€œA place for everything and everything in its placeâ€. This may not be original but that is where I first heard it. I let that little phrase dance through my head when I deal with my things. So, make a spot for all items that you have. If the items are keepers then make sure you have a shelf or a tote or box to deal with each item. There will be no question as to where something goes if it has a prepared place.\r\n\r\n4.Throw away anything that you really do not need and is not worth making a place for.\r\n\r\nRemember you just most likely canâ€™t keep every piece of art work your child brings home, or every issue of your favorite magazine, or every recipe that you print out. If it has value to you then make a file for the art work and resign to keep only a couple pieces each year, Buy a few large 3-ring bingers for the magazines and the recipes so that they have a neat organized place to be. Figure out what to do with the things you really want, toss or give away the rest.\r\nClutter can rule your life! It can make an otherwise reasonably clean home feel like a disaster. It can make you feel overwhelmed and depressed. Developing good clutter control habits will help to keep your home from feeling overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n', 52, '07 May, 2017', '2017-05-07', '10:28:33'),
(36, 'Homemade Household Cleaners', 'Make all of your own cleaners with natural products', NULL, 'There is a lot of reasons why making your own household cleaners is a good idea. I have read a lot of information on the dangers of common store bought cleaners. The list of dangers seems to encompass everything from breathing toxic fumes, the harmful effects of the cleaners on your skin to some cleaners being carcinogenic.\r\n\r\nAside from the health concerns there is also a financial consideration. Cleaners can be quite an expense on the budget. If you purchase a separate cleaner for everything from wiping down counters to cleaning floors, polishing and dusting, tub cleaners, toilet bowl cleaners, and the list goes on, this is a fairly large slice of the familyâ€™s budget.\r\n\r\nYou can make many of your own household cleaners utilizing some very basic and common ingredients. This does not have to take a lot of your time with mixing and making. Sometimes it is just a matter of a change in habit.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine once recommended using baking soda and Dawn detergent to clean the bath tub. No pre-mixing, simply sprinkle the baking soda on your tub and squirt some Dawn detergent and start scrubbing! I tried and it worked so well! Much better than many of the products I have used in the past and it does not scratch surfaces. Change of habits and a few extra minutes will usually be all that is required to make your cleaners.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some household cleaners that are basic simple recipes. Most you make up right in the spray bottle. If your cleaning shelves become stocked with the basic ingredients than putting them in the spray bottle takes close to the same amount of time as pouring the chemical laden store-bought cleaners right into the bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are wondering what this list of â€œbasic ingredientsâ€ are, I will show you:\r\n\r\nBaking Soda\r\nVinegar\r\nRubbing Alcohol\r\nWashing Soda (can be found near laundry detergent in most stores)\r\nBorax (also near the laundry section)\r\nMild Dish Detergent\r\n\r\nHow do you use these ingredient to clean you house, you may be wondering?\r\n\r\nLetâ€™s go through a breakdown of â€œtypesâ€ of cleaners that you can create with the above ingredients.\r\nFloor Cleaners\r\n\r\nHomemade Floor Cleaner\r\n1 cup white vinegar\r\n1 gallon warm water\r\nMix in your cleaning bucket and use this to clean vinyl type floors.\r\n\r\nWood Floor Cleaner\r\nÂ½ cup vinegar\r\n1 gallon water\r\nThe most important thing to keep in mind while cleaning wood floors is that they can not get overly wet. When you use the above mixture, dip your sponge mop into the solution and squeeze until almost dry. Then mop. Never put the cleaner directly on the floor. Dry any streaked or wet area with a clean towel as you go along the floor.\r\n\r\nAll Purpose Cleaners\r\nI like to make a large batch of my favorite household cleaner. I make this in a gallon size container and fill spray bottles as I need it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Homemade Cleaner\r\nCrystal Miller\r\nIn a clean, empty gallon milk jug put:\r\n2 Tablespoons ammonia\r\n1 teaspoon dish detergent\r\n1 pint (2 cups) rubbing alcohol\r\n4 drops food coloring â€“ optional\r\na few drops of your favorite essential oil for a nice fresh scent, I use Orange \r\nFill the rest of the gallon jug with hot water.  Pour into spray container to use.\r\n\r\nHere is a cleaner you make right in your spray bottle:\r\n\r\nAll-Purpose Cleaner\r\n2T vinegar\r\n1 t Borax\r\nHot water\r\na few drops of a mild dish detergent\r\n10 drops of essential oil, optional\r\nIn a 16 spray bottle put vinegar, borax and hot water. Swish around until borax has dissolved. Add the drops of dish detergent and fill the rest of the bottle with water. Add the essential oil (I like using orange or lavender).\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Purpose Cleaner in a Bucket (for big jobs like walls)\r\nÂ½ cup ammonia\r\nÂ¼ cup vinegar\r\nÂ¼ cup baking soda\r\nMix the above ingredients with 1 gallon of warm water and use for basic cleaning jobs around the home. Double the above ingredients for cleaning shower walls or other extra heavy duty areas.\r\n\r\nSoft Scrubbing Type Cleaners\r\nHere is one of my favorites for cleaning counter tops, sinks or any area that needs some scrubbing without the worry of scratching the surface.\r\nHomemade â€œsoft scrubâ€ Type Cleaner\r\n\r\nThere are no measurements necessary for this one. Simply put a small amount of baking soda in a bowl and add liquid dish detergent until you have smooth paste or frosting like substance. This very well on sinks and counters and wonâ€™t scratch the surface.\r\n\r\nWindow Cleaner\r\n\r\nHomemade Window Cleaner\r\nThis one can be made right in your spray bottle.\r\nÂ½ t mild dish detergent\r\n3T vinegar\r\n2 cups water\r\nPut all these ingredients into a spray bottle. Shake this up some and use it just like the commercial variety.\r\n\r\nHomemade Window Cleaner #2\r\n3T Ammonia\r\n1T vinegar\r\nPut in spray bottle and fill the rest of the way up with water.\r\n\r\nCommet Type Scrub Powders\r\nThis is an easy one. You can use baking soda! Sprinkle on sinks, counters or anywhere you need to get rid of build up or stains. Dampen slightly and scrub with a soft cloth to prevent scratching.\r\n\r\n****A word of caution on making homemade cleaners: never mix bleach with ammonia or vinegar. It will cause toxic fumes that are very dangerous.\r\n\r\n', 52, '07 May, 2017', '2017-05-07', '10:31:41'),
(37, 'Keeping the Balance While â€œKeeping the Houseâ€', 'Get a good handle on the daily cycle of household maintenance', NULL, 'My thoughts this month has been on keeping the balance in our homes and in our lives. Fall seems to be the season where routines and busyness can become the norm for our lives. For me, my homeschool schedule consumes a large portion of my day. Then I have all the regular things that make life function in my homeâ€¦. laundry, meals cooked, bread baked, and clutter picked up, cleaning done. And finally there are other creative pursuits and activities such as sewing and decorating, craft work. Sometimes in the past as I was trying to learn how to juggle all these different areas of life, the house would slide and become in disarray and be dirty. So the thoughts that came to my mind this month are on keeping our lives in some sort of balance, and focusing on the home and housekeeping specifically. \r\n\r\nThe first thing I think of as important to help us keep this balance is to rise early (if your schedule allows this) and get the dailies out of the way. What are the dailies?? To me they are.. unloading the dishwasher (or dish drainer/rack if you wash dishes by hand), start laundry or move laundry to the next step, making my bed, getting breakfast started. Then I make sure that my childrenâ€™s alarm clocks have gone off and they are up and doing their dailies too. They need to make their bed, pick up their room, dress down to shoes, and comb hair. Then after that they each have expected jobsâ€¦ some are outside and animal related and some help inside with the breakfast meal. \r\n\r\nThen the next thing after routines is to determine if you have a housekeeping plan. Do you have a plan for keeping your home clean and orderly. Housekeeping needs to have a plan. Remember that one of the most important aspects of being a homemaker is creating a loving and peaceful environment for your family. I have never been to a dirty home that felt peaceful. Not to say there was no peace possible, just that with so much chaos it could not be experienced. There was too much in the wayâ€¦. so to speak. The other important thing to keep in mind as you clean your home is that this is a service to those you love. This job is an act of your love to those who are nearest and closest to your heart. When my hubby comes home to a clean and orderly home where there is not a lot of chaos, this blesses him tremendously! When my children deal with daily life in a home that is clean it gives them more ability to focus on important areas of their growing lives. Clean homes are orderly homes. I know I can think much more clearly in a clean home than in a messy or dirty one. \r\n\r\nThe housekeeping plan you use needs to be one that works for you and your life. I have read lots of books and read many ideas and used different plans, but ultimately these plans and ideas were not the end in themselvesâ€¦ they were the means to creating my own plan. My home is unique and so is yours. I donâ€™t believe we could follow someone elseâ€™s plan exactly and have it work for us. We will tweak it and modify and then find something else and say.. â€œoh that might workâ€ and try it and tweak that, etc.. until after a time what you have is â€œyourâ€ plan. That is the goal! This is what you want to happen. But if you donâ€™t actively decide to create a plan, it will not happen. As the old saying goes.. â€œif you fail to plan, you plan to failâ€. \r\n\r\nAfter your plan is set, the next most important part is rolling up your sleeves and getting in there and doing it! Being a homemaker is hard work and it takes a lot of energy and determination each day. But it can be one of those areas in life where we can learn to get into the rhythm of the tasks and learn to appreciate things like warm soapy dishwater on our cold winter-time hands, the soothing hum of a washing machine going, the smell of dinner wafting through the home, the beauty of a shiny clean kitchen floor, the peace that comes from a home where all is clean and in order. We do not have to carry the weight on our backs of much cultural opinion of housekeeping; the drab, slavery type feelings that can permeate our society and attitudes. There is much to be gained in our life from not allowing these lies about this topic to come into our own views and give us incorrect messages, messages that are not as God would want us to have. In Titus 3:4 &5 we see that first women are told to love their husbands and children in verse 4 and then in verse 5 to be homemakers (among other godly qualities). This is an act of love for our family when we embrace a godly view of our role, not mundane meaningless work. \r\n\r\nAs a homemaker you have in your control the ability to create a mood and environment for your family and what an honor it is to do this! Think of all the other jobs and careers out there where the job is one of purely performing a repetitive function daily with little to no ability to make changes. When I think of that I realize what an honor the Lord has given us as homemakers to have this control and to use it to create something that will glorify Him!\r\n\r\nSo this month as I strive to keep my life in balance and to stay on top of the housework I will stick with good routines and a plan that always has room for improvement, as well as a desire to view my role as a homemaker as an honor before the Lord and an act of love and service to the family He has given me.\r\n', 52, '07 May, 2017', '2017-05-07', '10:34:30'),

When I make this for my very hungry family I usually make 3 batches. As soon as the first batch is finished I pour the batter into a juice pitcher and begin the next batch. My daughters are usually in the kitchen helping me with this and so one daughter is cooking while another is warming up syrup and yet another is setting the table while one of us is working on the next batch of pancake batter.
